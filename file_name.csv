know
i
don't
need
no
beat
i
can
sing
it
with
piano
playin'
everything
so
easy
it's
like
you
seem
so
sure
still
your
ways
you
dont
see
i'm
not
sure
if
they're
for
me
then
things
come
right
along
our
way
though
we
didn't
truly
ask
it
seem
as
if
they're
gonna
linger
with
every
delight
they
bring
just
like
what
you
have
truly
seem
i'm
try
to
think
of
what
you
really
want
to
say
even
through
my
darkest
day
you
might
want
to
leave
me
feel
strange
about
you
like
you're
gonna
let
me
know
when
word
then
slip
out
of
you
when
word
dont
come
so
easy
to
say
you
just
leave
me
feel
come
what
may
though
i
want
things
come
from
your
way
i
say
to
you
you
bore
me
all
the
time
when
you
seem
to
hold
back
all
in
you
all
that
you
want
to
let
me
know
why
dont
you
have
the
courage
speak
up
and
i'll
listen
if
you
truly
want
me
to
know
then
tell
me
be
there
something
wrong
with
you
and
you
seem
fasten
there
it
sound
as
if
there'll
be
a
melody
if
things
in
you
be
let
out
and
then
i
will
feel
alright
when
you
sleep
do
you
feel
the
same
exactly
as
i
do
i
really
want
to
hear
things
from
you
though
i've
felt
something
new
eversince
you
act
that
way
if
i
go
would
you
still
mind
tell
me
if
i
stay
you
seem
to
let
the
days
go
by
if
you
truly
want
to
let
me
know
then
tell
me
if
you
search
for
tenderness
it
isn't
hard
to
find
you
can
have
the
love
you
need
to
live
but
if
you
look
for
truthfulness
you
might
just
as
well
be
blind
it
always
seem
to
be
so
hard
to
give
chorus
honesty
be
such
a
lonely
word
everyone
be
so
untrue
honesty
be
hardly
ever
hear
and
mostly
what
i
need
from
you
i
can
always
find
someone
to
say
they
sympathize
if
i
wear
my
heart
out
on
my
sleeve
but
i
don't
want
some
pretty
face
to
tell
me
pretty
lie
all
i
want
be
someone
to
believe
chorus
i
can
find
a
lover
i
can
find
a
friend
i
can
have
security
until
the
bitter
end
anyone
can
comfort
me
with
promise
again
i
know
i
know
when
i'm
deep
inside
of
me
don't
be
too
concern
i
won't
ask
for
nothin'
while
i'm
go
but
when
i
want
sincerity
tell
me
where
else
can
i
turn
when
you're
the
one
that
i
depend
upon
chorus

oh
oh
i
oh
oh
oh
i
verse
if
i

a
book
about
where
we

we
teach
girls
to
shrink
themselves
to
make
themselves
smaller
we
say
to
girls
you
can
have
ambition
but
not
too
much
you
should
aim
to
be
successful
but
not
too
successful
otherwise
you
will
threaten
the
man
because
i
be
female
i
be
expect
to
aspire
to
marriage
i
be
expect
to
make
my
life
choices
always
keep
in
mind
that
marriage
be
the
most
important
now
marriage
can
be
a
source
of
joy
and
love
and
mutual
support
but
why
do
we
teach
girls
to
aspire
to
marriage
and
we
don't
teach
boys
the
same
we
raise
girls
to
each
other
as
competitors
not
for
job
or
for
accomplishments
which
i
think
can
be
a
good
thing
but
for
the
attention
of
men
we
teach
girls
that
they
cannot
be
sexual
be
in
the
way
that
boys
be
feminist
the
person
who
believe
in
the
social
political
and
economic
equality
of
the
sex
